# Python-Covid-19-Test-log

in this project i build a covid-19 test log form using python package called tkinter

in this program the clinic needs to enter patient detail in the log form and then press enter

those data are the stored in a text file connected with the program, so the text file will act as a storage history for the clinic data

it was really an exciting project and i am still working toward customizing it such as adding more feature to the login data form, and improving my codes
